## Description
The aim is to successfully convert English speech to Braille script. To do this we will need to follow 3 key steps:
1. Accpting an audio file from the user to be converted. The audio file can be .wav or .mp3 format.
2. Converting the loaded audio to text. We do this using AssemblyAI's API for conversion. The result is then stored in a text file
3. Finally, we convert the text file to Braille script and stores it in a .png file so that it is printer friendly.
