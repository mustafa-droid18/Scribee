This folder contains the codes to convert Speech (i.e .mp3/ .wav audio files) to Braille script. The final result is stored as a .png image so that it is suitable for printing. It consists of three codes: Speech to Text, Text to Braille and the final code records audio files in real time and converts it into braille script.
